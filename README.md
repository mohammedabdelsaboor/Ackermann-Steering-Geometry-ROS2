# Ackermann-Steering-Geometry-ROS2
This project implements an Ackermann steering control system for a mobile robot, using ROS 2 for communication and Arduino for hardware control. It simulates the steering behavior of a real car, allowing the robot to move and steer based on ROS 2 commands. The robot can navigate environments with standard ROS 2 messages.
ROS 2 (any distribution that supports rclcpp and serial packages) in this case i'm using humble 
Arduino IDE (to upload the sketch to the Arduino)
Arduino Uno or compatible board
Motor driver (L298N or any driver)
Servo motor for steering but in this project i'll use dc motor for steering 
Robot chassis with wheels and motors
